This is the game my group came up with for our final project.  It uses the "slick2D" framework for most of the behind the scenes stuff.

We wrote this in eclipse with JAVA.

In the end, we decided to "reskin" a dungeon level from the NES Legend of Zelda.  It's been a long while since I was involved with this project, so I don't remember any details.  I'm pretty sure this isn't the final version, but at least 90%.  Most of the graphics/animations were created in Blender.
